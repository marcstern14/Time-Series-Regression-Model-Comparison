# Time-Series-Regression-Model-Comparison
This is a reasearch study conducted by myself, Natasia Fernandez, and Sergey Zyl that compares regression models for predicting cumulative Confirmed Covid-19 Cases over time. In the study we look at different types of regression modelling as it pertains to time-series data, taken from NYTimes github, and the different tools that can create these models. Code for my portion of the study is provided (Linear Regression, ARMA model).
